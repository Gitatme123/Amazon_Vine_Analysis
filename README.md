# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
We are tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews by members of the paid and unpaid community in order to determine if there is bias among those reviews. I will be using skills that i've learned such as PySpark, ETL, pgAdmin, google collab and SQL to extract the data, transform the data, and load the data while running expressions in google collab to determine the answers I seek. I chose python and google collab to extract my answers due to my skill in that area as opposed to using SQL in pgAdmin.

## Results
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
